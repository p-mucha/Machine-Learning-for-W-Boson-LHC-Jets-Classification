# Machine-Learning-for-W-Boson-LHC-Jets-Classification

Note: This code is part of the code I wrote as my submission for the mini project from PHAS0056 Practical Machine Learning.

## Introduction

In this notebook, Convolutional Neural Network is developed to classify LHC jets from W bosons and QCD, using imaging technique. Images display transverse energy of the jet deposited in detectors. Jets from W bosons are considered signal and those from QCD - background.
